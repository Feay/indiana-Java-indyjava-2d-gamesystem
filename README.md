Indeed, this is not a Graphic Adventure Game (G.A.G.) as you might think. Rather, it's a system to create and run 2D graphic adventure games. No Java knowledge required! . No internet connection required! It includes a small fully playable adventure, for you to have fun immediately. It's entirely written in Java, so non-Wintel users can also enjoy playing and creating that kind of games.
