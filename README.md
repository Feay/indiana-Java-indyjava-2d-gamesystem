*THIS IS NOT A GAG! LULZ*
Indeed, this is not a Graphic Adventure Game (G.A.G.) as you might think. 
Rather, it's a system to create and run 2D graphic adventure games. No Java knowledge required! . No internet connection required! It includes a small fully playable adventure, for you to have fun immediately. It's entirely written in Java, so non-Wintel users can also enjoy playing and creating that kind of games.

ALSO, http://indyjava.tiddlyspot.com/ (Downloads do not work Good luck)



# Installing and Launching
------------------------------

      1. Download the Indyjava distribution package.
      2. Extract all files from the package into a temporary directory
         using your favorite Zip archiver.
      3. Open INDY.HTM with your browser and follow the instructions.
      0.R
      1. Or you launch the game by typing 
      JAVA -jar INDY.JAR 
      at the O.S. command prompt. (Also, if you use w95/98/NT and installed Java 1.2(or above), you just need to double click on INDY.JAR
      to launch the engine as an application. No need to mess with the command line.)
      

What is Indy Java? It's a multiplatform graphic adventure game system that can run from
a web browser.

It comes with a demo adventure that you can play immediately.

With IndyJava, you can also compile your own adventure games, and have your friends
playing them!(Tip: Load the applet and import a adv script to compile to gag ALSO The IndyJava engine always looks for a file called "resource.jar" and will use files stored there as well as those available in the current subdirectory.)


System requirements
---------------------------------
To run it, you can use any machine, running any operating system, as long as it has
some kind of Java 1.1 support. A Java-enabled web browser is enough.

The recommended setup is any workstation with a 24 bit color desktop at 640x480 with
sound, and running a Java 1.2 Runtime Interpreter independently of any browser.

# A few notes from FE: 
This engine that uses Java, assuming you have java2d (ie java 1.5 and up?) then the DLLs aren't needed at all. Loading the applet standalone works GREAT, as does using with netscape7.2, FF 53ESR has issue. You might have to add the folder location(in url form) to the security exception list in java's settnigs in controlpanel. To save a game you need to use the applet by it self.


Installation instructions
-------------------------------------
Download IndyJava and unzip it anywhere in your hardisk.

Load the page INDY.HTM into your favorite browser, and press the button.
That's it!

You should see the Indy window appearing.

Select File/New from the menu bar to play the demo adventure included
with this release.

From then on, you shouldn't need any manual(to play)! The interface mimicks the classic graphic
adventure games of the beginning of the 90's

You can press ESC to skip cutscenes, and press "." on the
numeric keypad to skip dialogue lines.

If you have problems, check the Troubleshooting guide.(FAQ IN DOCS)


Going further...
-----------------------------
Ok. You played that small java adventure. Now what? Is that all?

No, that was just a demo. You then have to start deciding if you want to write your own
adventure scripts for this engine, and have your friends puzzled for hours!  ;-)

Check the Developer's Manual(TUTORAL IN DOCS) for that. No
Java knowledge required!

On the other hand, if you don't want to do that, you will have to wait until somebody
writes a new adventure for the same game engine.
